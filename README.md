My personal website and portfolio.

Static HTML+CSS, minimum JS for maximum speed and compatibility.

I've moved to [Parcel](https://parceljs.org) to bundle all the code with minimum effort.

# How to use
## Installing
Run `yarn install` in the base directory.

##  Deploying
1.  Commit on development branch
2.  Run `npm run build` to create the files
3.  Run `npm run deploy` to publish on GitHub pages on master branch.

# Source
See the [development branch](https://github.com/QUB3X/qub3x.github.io/tree/development) for the actual source code.
