qub3x.github.io
===============

My personal website and portfolio. Static HTML/CSS and no JS for maximum speed and compatibility.

Decent gulp automated script to build and deploy the website through Github Pages.

See the [development branch](https://github.com/QUB3X/qub3x.github.io/tree/development) for the actual source code.
