This is ancient history.

CAHOnline was my and [aleasto](https://github.com/aleasto) take on a web port of the famous Cards Against Humanity. We used it as an occasion to test AngularJS and Socket.io in a small project. The final result was playable, with some occasional bug due to player disconnections or CSS device-related glitches.
