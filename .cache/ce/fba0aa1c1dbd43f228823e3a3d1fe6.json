It's still a work in progress, and I used\nit as my first opportunity to try unit tests in JavaScript.</p>\n<h2>Heroes API</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://glitch.com/~heroes-api\">Heroes API</a> was a test implementation of\nan unofficial REST API I made for Blizzard’s <a href=\"https://heroesofthestorm.com\">Heroes of the Storm</a>,\na game I often played with my friends. Since the game still haven't\nprovided its own API, I put together a scrapper to gather data from stats websites, which didn’t provide any APIs either. To maximize the efficiency of the API by caching the retrieved data,\nto minimize the impact on the websites it scrapped.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://glitch.com/~hots-discord-bot\">HotS Discord Bot</a> was a very quick Discord bot\nI coded to test and use the above Heroes API. Even though is now offline, it provided players with <a href=\"https://imgur.com/1fo5K5L\">basic stats</a> in a\nsimple and useful format.</p>\n<h2>DnD Spell Cards</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/QUB3X/dnd-spell-cards-online\">Dnd Spell Cards</a> was my first project with ReactJS,\nto help my friends keep track of their spells during our Dungeons &amp; Dragons sessions.</p>\n<h2>CAHOnline</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/QUB3X/CAHOnline\">CAHOnline</a> was my and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/yodevilhots\">@YoDevilHots</a> take on a web port of the famous Cards Against Humanity.\nWe used it as an occasion to test AngularJS and Socket.io in a small project. The final result was playable, with some occasional bug due to player disconnections or CSS device-related glitches.</p>\n</section><section class=\"notes\"><h2>Notes</h2>\n<p>There's also a collection of notes (in Italian) from University that I redacted with LaTeX or Markdown.
