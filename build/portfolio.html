Since three years after launch the game still doesn’t provides its own API, I decided to put together a scrapper to gather as much data as possible from various sites, which ironically don’t provide any APIs, too. I did all I could to maximize the efficiency of the API by caching the retrieved data, in order to not impact too much on scrapped websites resources. It’s hosted on <a href="https//glitch.com">Glitch.com</a>.</p></li><li><h3>HotS Discord Bot</h3><p><a href="https://glitch.com/~hots-discord-bot">HotS Discord Bot</a> is a very quick <span class="t-purple">Discord bot</span> I coded to test and use the above Heroes API. Even though is now offline, it provided players with basic stats in a <a href="https://imgur.com/1fo5K5L">quick and useful format</a>.</p></li><li><h3>DnD Spell Cards</h3><p><a href="https://github.com/QUB3X/dnd-spell-cards-online">Dnd Spell Cards</a> was my first project with <span class="t-blue">ReactJS</span>, to help me and my friends to keep track of their spells during our Dungeons & Dragons sessions.</p></li><li><h3>CAHOnline</h3><p><a href="https://github.com/QUB3X/CAHOnline">CAHOnline</a> was my and <a href="https://twitter.com/yodevilhots">@YoDevilHots</a> take on a web port of the famous Cards Against Humanity. We used it as an occasion to test  <span class="t-red">AngularJS</span> and <span class="t-green">Socket.io</span> in a small project. The final result was playable, with some occasional bug due to players disconnection or CSS device-related glitches.</p></li><li><h3>LIM</h3><p><a href="https://github.com/QUB3X/LIM">LIM</a> was one of the first projects I and <a href="https://twitter.com/yodevilhots">@YoDevilHots</a> eventually finished during high-school. It was a desktop app built on <a class="t-blue" href="https://electronjs.org">ElectronJS</a> and vanilla <a class="t-yellow">HTML5 Canvas</a> that aimed to provide an extremely simple interface to help not-really-tech-savvy teachers to draw on interactive whiteboards.</p></li><li><h3>Other Projects</h3><p>I have of course used other programming languages, including <span class="t-green">Python</span> and recently <span class="t-yellow">Swift</span>, although I’ve never actually finished a project to a point I considered myself satisfied with it. iOS Development was quite interesting and I had a couple of apps in the works, which unfortunately I don’t think I’ll have time to finish due to time constraints.</p></li></ul></div></article><footer>© Andrea Franchini 2018, unless otherwise specified</footer></div></body></html>
