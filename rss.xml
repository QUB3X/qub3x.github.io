&lt;p&gt;This paper analyzes issues found in online proctoring tools (OPT),
addressing in particular privacy and fairness concerns about this kind
of software. While OPT are a solution that allows institutions to hold
exams during pandemics, the way they work represents an invasion of
students’ privacy, raising the question of whether said invasion is
justified in the name of academic integrity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lack of external regulation about OPT use of artificial intelligence
(AI) results sometimes in biased systems that can discriminate students.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OPT that enforce strict requirements may also put at disadvantage
certain individuals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Online proctoring tools (OPT) are a category of software that allow
students to take exams remotely under strict supervision provided by a
software, a human, or both.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While OPT have been around for more than a decade, the sudden shift to
remote learning caused by the COVID-19 pandemic produced a surge in
adoptions of such kind of software.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OPT allow institutions to hold exams sessions while preventing students
from cheating (e.g.: using hidden notes, communicating with others or
even having another person taking the exam in their place).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because of their sudden and widespread adoption, there has been little
time for institutions, and people in general, to address concerns about
privacy and fairness offered by these tools, especially when deployed at
such massive scale.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I believe that there is need for stricter regulations about OPT, as
privacy and fairness play have a key role in this kind of software.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This topic is crucial since we do not know how long this software will
be adopted by institutions and the side effects they might have in the
near-future. Major control over this technology can help avoid
unpleasant situations for students.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With “privacy” I mean the fundamental right of students to
have the bounds of their personal space respected by others. In a normal
scenario, an institution should not have access or be interested in
details of a student’s personal life, beside the personal
data needed for bureaucratic and administrative reasons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whenever institutions overstep this initially set bound of their
relations with students, we shall evaluate if it is necessary, and why.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In an education environment, “fairness” goes two ways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first is the students’ relationship towards their
instructors, meaning that students have to pledge to the institution
code of conduct (e.g.: not to cheat during exams or engage in other
forms of dishonesty). We may call this “academic
integrity”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other is an institution relationship towards its students, in which
the first must guarantee inclusiveness, prevent discriminations of any
kind from happening and ensure impartiality in evaluations of
students’ work. For example, exams should be accessible to
all student regardless of ethnicity and gender, and account for students
with disabilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, privacy and fairness are related: when respecting the privacy
of students, instructors may be more impartial during grading because
they lack knowledge of private details that might make them biased
towards certain students.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Better understanding of OPT can help both students and institutions in
highlighting and addressing typical concerns of this technology; in
particular, students should be better informed of how OPT work, and how
these tools may represent a risk for their privacy and fair-treatment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this paper, I will try to offer compelling arguments on how
students’ right to privacy is often violated and how
fairness is not always ensured when employing OPT.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How OPT and Remote Exams work&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before introducing my arguments, I want to better explain what an OPT
consists of and how a remote exam works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An OPT is composed roughly of two macro-components: the student’s one
and the institution’s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first consists of a software run by the student’s
computer under the form of a web browser extension or application for
the operative system. This software accesses the webcam and microphone
connected to the student’s computer, in order to record
their behaviors during exams; it may also require students to share what
they see on the screen with their instructors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In certain cases, it can also prevent the student from using other
softwares unless explicitly allowed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The latter is used to process and store said recording of students,
showing them to instructors during or after an exam, and flag suspect
behaviors of students.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most well-known and diffused OPT are commercial proprietary software
that is licensed to institutions. Most OPT companies also provide
hosting solutions for institutions, meaning that recordings are stored
on the company servers instead of the institution servers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A remote exam requires students to authenticate themselves in order to
prove their identity, usually by framing a valid document, and to scan
their room, to show that nobody else is present and that they do not
have any unapproved material.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once the exam starts, students need to remain framed by the webcam for
its whole duration, and suspect behaviors such staring in another
direction or people talking are notified to both the student and the
proctor (human or virtual).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This analysis is usually automated and carried out by an artificial
intelligence (AI).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Students also must not interact with any other computer application if
the latter is not already blocked by the proctoring software.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Depending on the configuration, an OPT may require a review by a human
proctor before disqualifying a student when enough reports of suspect
behavior are present.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Privacy&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first privacy issue with OPT is that such tools require students to
record not only themselves, but also their entire room. This causes OPT
to collect a huge quantity of data that are related to the student, but
ultimately unrelated to the exam. Some services such as ProctorExam even
require the use of a smartphone as an additional point of view to record
the back of the student, therefore obtaining a detailed, 360-degrees
view of the room. In addition, there is a chance to expose personal
details of a student private life when they are required to scan their
rooms in the authentication process. Some students may agree with such
methods, but others may not want to be forced to expose personal spaces
to an external eye, especially when they must share a room with others
during lockdowns caused by a pandemic. Because the perception of what is
private is often subjective, it is difficult to make absolute
conclusions about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my opinion a full scan of the room is an invasion of the
students’ privacy from an ethical point of view for the
following reasons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a traditional exam held in a classroom or similar facility, students
can see who is watching over them, and beside their physical person, no
other personal information is directly deducible. In a remote exam
context, though, the overseer is no longer in students’
reach: it becomes an abstract entity that do not directly interact with
them; it may also not be their instructor, but an employee of an OPT
company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s make the hypothesis that in an exam held in the
classroom the privacy of both students and their proctors is respected:
both sides have few ways to violate each other privacy, and if they did,
it would be immediately witnessed by others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a remote setting students cannot know who, if any, is watching their
recording, and what are they looking for. Often, students do not even
have access to their own recordings, because they are managed by the
institution on their behalf.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus, the access to private information on each side is no longer
symmetric, and students have more to lose in a remote exam than in a
classroom exam. Students need to sacrifice their right to privacy to be
able to take exams: if no alternatives are offered, though, it is very
likely that students would rather take an exam with a tool they do not
agree on, rather than forfeiting it, putting them in a difficult
position.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The idea of having a stranger peeking in one’s room is
often unsettling for some people, and students are even more legitimated
to be wary of such tools when many universities decided to have
mandatory proctored exams by using OPT. Of course, this led to
widespread protests from students (Kelley 2020).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A possible counter-argument by supporters of OPT is that since students
already have to allow an invasion of their privacy in the classroom, by
being closely monitored by instructors, remote surveillance is ethically
equivalent in-classroom surveillance. An excellent confutation is
provided by (Coghlan, Miller, and Paterson 2020), who state that to make
in-classroom exams truly equivalent to remote ones, there should be a
proctor in front of each student staring at them for the whole duration
of their exam, possibly with an AI assistant to analyze each minuscule
face movement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I find this last argument plausible because it shows that remote
surveillance, thanks to the presence of AI tools, allows instructors to
monitor students in greater detail, and that such strict surveillance if
actually carried out in-class would be definitely unsettling to a
student. In addition, OPT allow a single instructor to monitor many
student at greater detail, a feat that would be unrealistic in a
traditional classroom, further proving the non-equivalence between
remote and in-class proctoring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I believe that OPT and institutions should address with more
consideration students that desire a higher level of privacy. Let us
consider the following example: student A wants to share the least
amount of private details with the proctor, while student B does not
care. If we regard mostly B’s view, possibly requiring them
to share a detailed recording of their room, then A has more to lose
than B, namely B’s privacy. If we consider the opposite
case, though, since B does not care, A is in a better position. Thus, in
this kind of situations, it is a better compromise to second
B’s needs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We might also want to examine a possible reason for B lack of interest:
perhaps B was not informed in a direct way of what are the implication
of the use of OPT. While OPT clearly explain to students which of their
data they will have access to, but how these data will be processed in
detail is not specified.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While this example seems to work, we are not considering an important
factor, which is the role of the proctor (human or virtual). To prevent
cheating, institutions employ OPT to make sure that cheating material
and other people are not present.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, the system receives the integral audio and video recording of
students and stores them, then analyzes them to determine whether there
was an instance of cheating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is obvious that OPT end up with lots of irrelevant data for their
purpose, such as a picture a student may have on their wall, or how big
is their house. Then why and for how long these private data should be
stored when they no longer serve a purpose?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An immediate answer would probably state to discard them immediately, as
they no longer serve a purpose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is actually little reason for a proctoring tool company to
actively discard such data that is embedded in a video recording, as it
would mean to actively dedicate resources to edit out the details, for
example by blurring them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To a machine trained to recognize objects like smartphones, since it is
not a sentient being, it should not really matter who the subject of a
photo hanging from the wall is (except in cases where bias is involved
which I will analyze in the next section). It also should not affect the
security of students unless a malicious design is involved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With a human proctor, the situation is a different: there is no
technologic protection put in place to make sure that a proctor does not
focus too much on details that are already deemed unnecessary. Most
importantly, they must not disclose or use for other purposes those
recordings without consent, for example, by taking a picture or a video
with their smartphones and sharing it online. Should that happen, that
would result in a massive violation of a student’s privacy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition, companies often reserve their right to retain recording for
long period of time, for a maximum of five years in the case of
Respondus and two years in the case of ProctorU, or they delegate this
right to institutions, as ProctorExam does: in both cases, it is out of
students’ control whenever this data is deleted or
accessed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A question that we must ask ourselves is whether such invasion of
privacy is justified in name of the academic integrity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the interest of institution in preventing cheating is clearly
legitimate from an academic point of view, and it is already enforced
during in-class exams, the way OPT have been quickly adopted makes me
think that these tools have been seen as an easy solution to the complex
problem that is remote teaching. I said “easy solution”
because OPT have been developed with one and only one purpose, that is
to detect students that cheat. Other “more complex”
solutions, such as rethinking the structure of an exam to make cheating
harder, clearly require effort from the instructors and therefore this
option usually is not immediately considered as an alternative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Fairness&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One critical issue is the perceived fairness of OPT. My argument is that
due to their unclear inner workings, it’s hard to prove that OPT are
truly fair and unbiased in their job and use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first immediate consideration about OPT is how little we know about
how they function internally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will argue that it is not possible to prove the fairness of OPT if we
cannot trust them first.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is caused by two factors: the use of AI, and the proprietary
license of these tools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ll address first the proprietary nature of this kind of softwares.
Since OPT are commercial products, it is in their owners’ interest to
prevent their competitors from learning how their software works,
therefore their source code is often kept secret. In addition, OPT
companies usually offer their product as a service, meaning that the
software runs on their servers and the data is usually stored in a
datacenter under their control. This means that an external party has no
way to know how an online proctoring system works: it is in fact a
blackbox to them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my opinion, OPT being blackboxes represent a major concern about the
trust we put into these systems. Although companies must respect strict
requirements about how they must handle their customers’ data, security
breaches are possible, as in the case of ProctorU (Abrams 2020), and
represent a threat to the students’ privacy and the trust that student
are required to put in these companies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I believe that if these companies open-sourced at least parts of their
code, there would be a great benefit for all: third-party analysis may
highlight flaws that a company didn’t notice, concerned users might
have the possibility to better understand how the software works and
companies would still be able to monetize their product through licenses
and by providing the service just as they already do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think that (Hoepman and Jacobs 2007) offer a detailed analysis on why
open source is not a liability for companies that handle sensible data,
showing that it’s more convenient to trust a company that opens its
software and design to a public inspection than one that keep the inner
workings secret.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This could help build trust between students and proctoring tools, and,
most importantly, allow institutions to make a more informed choice
about which OPT to adopt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other reason why it is hard to understand how an OPT works is the
use of AI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the advent of machine learning, most AI are trained on huge
datasets, which makes them harder to replicate and to understand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since AI are great at repeating complex task in a shorter time than
humans, they are used in OPT for two purposed: speed up authentication,
and identify suspect behaviors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On paper, AI should do their job without issues but in reality, they
have many edge cases in which they fail. Yet, because of their complex
nature, it is hard for a company to pinpoint the issue, and even harder
for an external viewer to figure out why the tool is not manifesting the
correct behavior.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When an AI fails to do its job, or does it wrong, there are serious
implications. It is also important to understand what is behind a
misbehaving AI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One common issue with AI used to analyze images of humans is that they
often fail to recognize certain individuals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is often the result, in the best scenario, of an oversight from the
AI designers and in the worst, of an intentional malicious design: in
both cases, the result is a biased AI, that often produce racist or
sexist outputs. For example, people of color have trouble being
recognized by such systems, that either think that no person is present,
or that there’s a lack of light. Another example is how a rigid
classification into ”male” or ”female” that simplify the development
of an AI fails to properly categorize transgender and non-binary people
(Gebru 2019).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a OPT authentication process, a student ID is compared to what the
webcam is recording, usually to prevent someone else to impersonate a
student. If a webcam isn’t able to detect a face, or the algorithm
thinks that the person visible to the webcam does not match the student
ID details, it may deny them the possibility of taking an exam, or
require the intervention of a human proctor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My belief is that such a strict system is unfair toward students for the
following reason. The only advantage of an automated process is a faster
admission to an exam for many, possibly white, gender-conforming
students, at the expenses of a minorities that need assistance because
of faulty software. This is not an acceptable compromise for any
institution that values the equal-treatment of their students, because
if the software consistently misbehaves in presence of certain
individuals, it clearly does not ensures that the latter are treated
fairly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another drawback is that students forced to require assistance may also
go through embarrassing and possibly traumatic moments: for example, a
transgender student may be outed by the system to a stranger, and they
need to be notified of the possibility of such situations (Swauger
2020).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These cons lead me to think that AI-based authentication systems are
largely unnecessary because they try to make the manual authentication
of students a problem, when it was not in first place: instructors could
verify identity of students manually in a similar fashion to what
happens in a in-class exam, or, if the time is a concern, during the
exam. It is unclear to me, though, why a company would push for the use
of AI for authentication as a solution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are still issues that happen during an exam. The first one is how
OPT present a classist view in how they expect a student to setup their
workspace in preparation to an exam, the second one is what should an
OPT see as a presence of misconduct.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OPT, as already said, require students to setup their workspace
adequately, meaning that the ambient should be well lit, without noise,
people, pets and that they should be visible, possibly from two angles.
My argument is that the requirement of OPT are not fair towards certain
category of students.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Especially during lockdowns, students who live in a one-room flat with
their own family may not be able to find sufficient space to satisfy the
OPT demands. It may be impossible for a student whose parents work from
home and have little siblings to find the necessary space and quiet in
order to take an exam: it is likely that someone else will end up
recorded by the webcam. Beside the student, this kind of situation
creates uneasy conditions for others: for example, students living with
toddlers can not be sure that there will be silence during their exams.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since OPT require an Internet connection with a fair amount of
bandwidth, this might hinder tasks like remote working, not be a reality
in first place, especially for students living in remote areas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Comparing this scenario to one in which students have their own room,
OPT favors the latter, thus treating the first unfairly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Noisy neighbors might also be a problem, as not all houses have a good
sound insulation and load voices may be flagged by system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I believe that institutions that do not allow alternative methods or
provide students with a public space with all due safety precautions
where to take exams are unfair in the treatment of their students, in
this case with proctoring tools representing as a gap between students
who can afford better conditions (a larger place, stable Internet
connections) and those who cannot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similar concerns are raised by (Coghlan, Miller, and Paterson 2020), who
also propose that universities might loan devices for students who
cannot afford a computer or webcam, as well as allowing selected student
to take their exams on campus. They highlight how this solution might
cause delays in courses and other logistical issues. While I agree with
such solutions, I believe that offering students alternatives in these
kind of situations should be a priority for any institute.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During exams, OPT analyze student behaviors in search of possible sign
of cheating. I believe it is quite hard to make an arbitrary list of
what is cheating and what is not. Therefore, designers of OPT have tried
to guess what is a likable sign of cheating. Turning the head, averting
the gaze from the computer screen, but also scratching and other minor
movements are sufficient to get a student behavior flagged as
suspicious.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my opinion watching out for such a huge number of factors is
excessive, especially in light of evidence that not always a directional
change of a student’s gaze represents an instance of cheating;
nonetheless many behaviors that can flag a student are also signs of
anxiety (Kolski and Weible 2019).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This creates unfavorable conditions for students that have disabilities
or more generally have involuntary behaviors caused by anxiety or tics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I believe that systems that are too strict, notify students too much or
even stop their exams for some seconds in presence of suspicious
behaviors can negatively impact students’ performances an produce an
unnecessary uncomfortable experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even for neurotypical, able-bodied students it is natural to stretch,
roll up eyes in front of a difficult question, or softly re-read their
answers to relieve stress, yet such behaviors are supposed to be a sign
of cheating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being flagged repeatedly may cause a termination of a student exam, in
certain cases. To prevent this kind of situations, the decision of what
to do with flagged students falls to a human proctor, when present. At
first we might think that the presence of a proctor would make a system
less biased, but it in reality people can over-trust AI or may be unsure
on how to interpret the findings presented to them by the AI (Coghlan,
Miller, and Paterson 2020). I believe that the claim of human proctors
not being completely reliable is plausible, because a proctor who isn’t
familiar with the student might not be aware of a student possible
conditions. An instructor that sees a student repeatedly flagged may
also want to question them separately to assert their effective
knowledge of the exam’s subject: while it is the instructor’s job, it
may be unfair for a student whose behavior would have otherwise gone
unnoticed in class, thus causing unnecessary stress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I want now to discuss if it is possible to ensure fairness in OPT.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I believe that in their current form OPT are more of a trouble to
students than an helpful tool. They represent a vision of technology as
barrier to illicit behaviors such as cheating, rather than an enabler of
new way of teaching and assessing students’ abilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While a poorly designed AI might be eventually fixed, I believe that its
use can still raise concerns because of the difficulty in understanding
such tools, thus the need of stricter regulations pertaining the use of
AI with personal data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The idea of preventing cheating is clearly motivated by the will of
institutions in ensuring a fair exam to students, and I agree with such
view, but extra care needs to be taken to ensure that the exam is fair
towards students with disabilities or who are neurodivergent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While OPT represented an immediate and easy solution for institutions
looking for a way to hold exams during a pandemic, few concerns have
been raised about the use of such technology, in particular about
privacy and fairness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These tools invade the students’ privacy and collect huge amount of
unnecessary data, a far greater amount than what could be gathered from
an equivalent, in-class scenario. The way recording of students are
stored and accessed also raise concern regarding their illegitimate use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fairness has to be ensured when the design of such tool requires the use
of AI to process recording of students, in order to prevent
discrimination and false positive caused by students that have
disabilities or are neurodivergent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, these tools are common despite the lack of strict and specific
regulations about their use, which are needed to better safeguard
students’ privacy and rights to a fair education.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Institutions should take additional care in deciding whether to use
these tools, inform students in detail about how these tools work, and
to opportunely configure them in order to allow student major control
over their data.&lt;/p&gt;

I worked in team with two fine fellow engineers, &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/ferrohd&quot;&gt;@ferrohd&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/luigifusco&quot;&gt;@luigifusco&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It consisted of a digital implementation of the tabletop game ”&lt;a href=&quot;https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/194655/santorini&quot;&gt;Santorini&lt;/a&gt;”, an indeed very boring game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The scope of the project was to achieve a working Java implementation of a server and clients, using sockets for connectivity, MVC design pattern, and others patters as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The part I feel most proud of is the perfectly working 3D view of the game using JavaFX (which definitely is not to be used for 3D games, as it lack a decently writted API documentation).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s not talk about the part in which the 2D/3D assets weren’t licensed by the university, or so I’ve been told. Hmm, I wonder &lt;a href=&quot;https://apps.apple.com/us/app/santorini-board-game/id1456647343&quot;&gt;where they come from&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s a little sneak peek at how it look (since you’d have to download the JAR’s from GitHub to play it):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-resp-iframe-wrapper&quot; style=&quot;padding-bottom: 56.42857142857143%; position: relative; height: 0; overflow: hidden; margin-bottom: 1.0725rem&quot; &gt; &lt;div class=&quot;embedVideo-container&quot;&gt; &lt;iframe title=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://player.vimeo.com/video/485526632&quot; class=&quot;embedVideo-iframe&quot; style=&quot;border:0; position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; &quot; loading=&quot;eager&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Relevant literature&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The book ”&lt;a href=&quot;https://gameprogrammingpatterns.com/&quot;&gt;Game Programming Patterns&lt;/a&gt;” (which I recommend) from Bob Nystrom has helped me understand certain pattern uses in game development (especially the &lt;em&gt;flyweight&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;command&lt;/em&gt; one).&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Composer]]></title><description><![CDATA[This project took me and @chiarabia a semester to complete, and there are still some issue that one day I’ll iron out.

&lt;p&gt;The idea was to make a software that allowed users to obtain a runnable code to be used on robots, in our case, an Arduino-powered device able to play sounds. It provides a rather intuitive interface where you can edit musical notes, activate motors and turn on LEDs. Users can then export their sequence as JSON or an Arduino Sketch (basically C, and at the time I had zero idea of how a compiler worked internally).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was made with extendability in mind, written and documented in TypeScript, and with standard libraries. It’s been a good occasion to learn ReactJS and Redux, along with some good design patterns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/QUB3X/composer&quot;&gt;live demo&lt;/a&gt; of the project, hosted on Netlify.&lt;/p&gt;

Since the game (which is kinda dead now) still hasn’t provided its own API to see player stats, I put together a scrapper to gather data from third-party websites that parsed replays submitted by players. &lt;em&gt;Of course&lt;/em&gt;, they didn’t provide any APIs either. I took care of caching the retrieved data, to minimize the impact on the websites it scrapped. Anyway, none of those website are online anymore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To test the features of this API, I also scrapped together a Discord bot that provided players with basic stats in a simple and useful format.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was hosted on &lt;a href=&quot;https://glitch.com/edit/#!/heroes-api&quot;&gt;Glitch.com&lt;/a&gt;, a lovely website I always recommend to test small NodeJS server.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[CAHOnline]]></title><description><![CDATA[This is ancient history.

&lt;p&gt;CAHOnline was my and &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/aleasto&quot;&gt;aleasto&lt;/a&gt; take on a web port of the famous Cards Against Humanity. We used it as an occasion to test AngularJS and Socket.io in a small project. The final result was playable, with some occasional bug due to player disconnections or CSS device-related glitches.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item></channel></rss>
