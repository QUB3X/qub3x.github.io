## Projects

### SuperCoolOrg/server

[This project](https://github.com/supercoolorg/server)
I contributed to is an implementation from scratch of a game server with 
UDP sockets trying to account for delays and make predictions to achieve
a fluid gameplay on the clients. It's still a work in progress, and I used
it as my first opportunity to try unit tests in JavaScript.

### Heroes API

[Heroes API](https://glitch.com/~heroes-api) was a test implementation of
an unofficial REST API I made for Blizzard’s [Heroes of the Storm](https://heroesofthestorm.com). Since the game still hasn't provided its own API, I put together a scrapper to gather data from stats-aggregator websites, that didn’t provide any APIs either. To maximize the efficiency of the API by caching the retrieved data,
to minimize the impact on the websites it scrapped.

[HotS Discord Bot](https://glitch.com/~hots-discord-bot) was a very quick Discord bot
I coded to test and use the above Heroes API. Even though is now offline, it provided players with [basic stats](https://imgur.com/1fo5K5L) in a 
simple and useful format.

### DnD Spell Cards
[Dnd Spell Cards](https://github.com/QUB3X/dnd-spell-cards-online) was my first project with ReactJS,
to help my friends keep track of their spells during our Dungeons & Dragons sessions.

### CAHOnline
[CAHOnline](https://github.com/QUB3X/CAHOnline) was my and [@YoDevilHots](https://twitter.com/yodevilhots) take on a web port of the famous Cards Against Humanity.
We used it as an occasion to test AngularJS and Socket.io in a small project. The final result was playable, with some occasional bug due to player disconnections or CSS device-related glitches.
