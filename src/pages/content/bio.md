## Bio
I have a keen interest in Game Design and Development,
but I often tinker with JavaScript and plenty of Web Technologies, too.

I enjoy creating small tools, and I care to make them look good and work great!

Iâ€™m currently a full-time Computer Science and Engineering student at 
[Politecnico di Milano](https://www.polimi.it), Italy.
