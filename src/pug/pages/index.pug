            | I have a keen interest in 
            span.t-green Game Design
            |  and Development, but I often tinker with 
            span.t-yellow JavaScript
            |  and plenty of  
            span.t-blue Web Design
            |  related stuff, too. I enjoy creating useful things, and I care to make them look good.
